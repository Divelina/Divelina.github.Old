                                And still quite simple. Despite the title promising revelations, I am still not ready
                                to share these reasons. I haven't yet gathered the mental power to write them down
                                objectively. In fact, I haven't taken a decision yet. I'll play around with this blog 
                                and other tasks that the SoftUni courses offer and I'll see if I'll stay as enthusiastic
                                about programming as I'm now.
